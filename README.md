OOOOOHHHHHHH MYYYY GYYYYYAAAADDDDDD another client by the almighty super skidder zprestige ANNNDDDDD ITS "PROTECTED" BY QSHIT (aka qProtect) which I have seen being compared to zkm when its just a skidded mess. The all knowing jvm wizard brownie has also been seen saying that QSHIT cracks can be PATCHED SERVER SIDE. Brownie refuses to believe that anything obfuscated by his product can be reversed and this is living proof so f*ck u brownie 

Prestige was a shit show from the release, it's a horrible "ghost" client which is a fabric mod and breaks everytime he skids a new module into it, and when I say NOTHING is original I'm not even joking even his shitty crown logo was STOLEN FROM 3000IQPlay. Calling it a ghost client is a bit far though cuz he ships the jar with a deleter exe which just forcefully removed the jar and runs the java garbage collector putting Pisstige back where it should be (the bin)
